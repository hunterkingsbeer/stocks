# Investment Portfolio iOS App

[![Swift](https://github.com/hunterkingsbeer/stocks/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hunterkingsbeer/stocks/actions/workflows/swift.yml)

An iOS app to track my investments.
Other apps I've tried weren't very good, so I created this.

This is a work in progress and a side project, so it is still an early prototype and has many features unimplemented.
